### About
This is a collector repo for my framework and game engine. <br>I am working on this as a hobby. Feel free to fix any bug or error if you would like to.

## Future plans:
<p>- reworked rendering system
<br>- reworked compressing system
<br>- some type of AI
<br>- like nvidia surround, but inbuilt and with mixed resolution
<br>- full graphical interface
<br>- c# support (with the choice of C#/C++)
<p> I will also try to add some unique rendering system, as well as compressing system.
